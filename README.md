# text-generation-lstm
This project is a complete end-to-end LSTM-based Text Generation Model built in Python using PyTorch. The model is trained on the "Alice in Wonderland" dataset from Project Gutenberg, it generates text based on a given prompt.  The project includes dataset preprocessing, LSTM model architecture, training pipeline, and text generation output file.
