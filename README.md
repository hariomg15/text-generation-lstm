# text-generation-lstm
This project is a complete end-to-end LSTM-based Text Generation Model built in Python using PyTorch. The model is trained on the "Alice in Wonderland" dataset from Project Gutenberg, it generates text based on a given prompt.  The project includes dataset preprocessing, LSTM model architecture, training pipeline, and text generation output file.

# 📝 LSTM Text Generation Model — Alice in Wonderland Dataset

This project implements an end-to-end **LSTM-based text generation model** using **Python** and **PyTorch**.  
The model is trained on the *Alice in Wonderland* dataset sourced from Project Gutenberg and is capable of generating creative English sentences based on a given starting prompt.
